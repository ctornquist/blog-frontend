# Title

made a blog-tile thing!

link: ct-cs52-blog.surge.sh. 
^github is weird so just copy/paste

## What Worked Well
- body supports markdown
- I think the pink/blue style combo looks nice
- the routing works as it should, can move around the site easily

## What Didn't
- I get a weird error about middleware when I try to add a new post, but everything works correctly. had a few TAs who wouldn't figure it out so just decided to leave it
- can't move around the blog tiles, and they only show up in a single column on the main page
