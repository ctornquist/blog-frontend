# Title

made a blog-tile thing!

[deployed url](ct-cs52-blog.surge.sh)

## What Worked Well
- body supports markdown
- I think the pink/blue style combo looks nice
- the routing works as it should, can move around the site easily

## What Didn't
- can't move around the blog tiles, and they only show up in a single column on the main page

## Screenshots
