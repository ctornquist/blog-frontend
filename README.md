# README

This is a blog style site I made in React/Redux to learn routing in React and user authentication. Users can sign up/in, view the list of blog posts, open a post to a full page article and edit/delete posts. Currently working on some additional features including: filter by tags, only be able to edit your own posts, and draggable tiles on the main page. 

### To View
You can see the deployed site at this link: ct-cs52-blog.surge.sh   
To view it in development mode, on terminal:  
1. yarn install  
2. yarn start
